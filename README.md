# California Housing Price Prediction - EDA Project

## Project Overview

This project is an exploratory data analysis (EDA) focusing on the California Housing dataset. The main goal is to understand factors that influence housing prices in California by examining data trends, distributions, and relationships between variables. Insights gained from this analysis are aimed at identifying key predictors for potential future modeling.

## Key Steps

1. **Data Cleaning**  
   - Addressed missing values and handled outliers to prepare a clean dataset for analysis.

2. **Exploratory Analysis**  
   - Analyzed distributions of features, correlations between variables, and observed trends within the dataset.

3. **Visualizations**  
   - Created visual plots to illustrate relationships among variables, enhancing understanding of influential factors.

## Findings

- **Income and Prices**  
   - A strong positive correlation was identified between median income and housing prices, suggesting that income is a significant factor in price variations.

- **Regional Factors**  
   - Certain regional attributes were found to have substantial effects on housing prices across different areas in California.

## Requirements

- **Python**: Version 3.8 or above
- **Libraries**: 
  - `Pandas`
  - `NumPy`
  - `Matplotlib`
  - `Seaborn`
